# Pedestrian_Footfall_Counter
A Python program detecting pedestrians in a video footage and counting their frequency.

This project aims to count the number of pedestrians frequenting an area, and checking that the number of pedestrians allowed in an area does not exceed the maximum limit. This is to maintain COVID-19 protocols and follow social distancing.

## Key Concepts implemented :- 
Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, HOG Descriptor (Histogram of Oriented Gradients).

## Files included in the project :- 
The following files included in this repository are collectively necessary for implementing the project.
1. _pedestrian_footfall_counter.py_ : Main Python script which contains the source code for the project. Uses an external video file which is read from directory to test the project on.
2. _walking.avi_ : Sample video file. Used by the project source code to test the functionality of the Pedestrian Footfall Counter.
