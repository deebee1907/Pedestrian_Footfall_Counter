# Pedestrian_Footfall_Counter
A Python program detecting pedestrians in a video footage and counting their frequency.

This project aims to count the number of pedestrians frequenting an area, and checking that the number of pedestrians allowed in an area does not exceed the maximum limit. This is to maintain COVID-19 protocols and follow social distancing.
